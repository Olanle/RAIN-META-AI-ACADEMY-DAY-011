        "Over the past weeks, we've gone on an incredible journey:\n",
        "*   We **built** models with PyTorch.\n",
        "*   We **deployed** models in apps with Streamlit.\n",
        "*   We built a single **agent** that could use tools.\n",
        "*   We gave an AI expert **knowledge** with RAG.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, we take the final and most exciting step: we will build a **team of AI agents that collaborate, critique, and improve their work** to solve a complex problem. We're moving from a single worker to an entire digital assembly line, powered by **LangGraph**.\n",

        "### **Why LangGraph? The Problem with Simple Agent Chains**\n",
        "\n",
        "Our previous agent was powerful but worked in a straight line. What if a task requires a loop? What if we need an agent to review work and send it *back* for revisions? This is where standard agent loops fall short.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph allows us to define agent workflows as a **state machine**.\n",
        "*   **Analogy:** Think of it like a board game.\n",
        "    *   **The State** is the game board, holding all the current information (the topic, search results, draft article).\n",
        "    *   **The Nodes** are the players (our Searcher, Writer, and Reviewer agents). Each player takes a turn to change the board.\n",
        "    *   **The Edges** are the rules that decide which player moves next, allowing for loops and complex decision-making.\n",
